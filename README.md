The goal of this project is to develop software for identifying the road/path images for an electric shuttle on a university campus. 

he project involves building an image segmentation algorithm that can identify the road/path in an image captured by the shuttle's cameras. The image segmentation algorithm will be integrated into the overall system, which will guide the shuttle to its destination.
The project involves several steps, including data collection, pre-processing, and training the image segmentation model. The image segmentation algorithm will be evaluated and refined based on its accuracy and efficiency. The final product will be tested using a set of new images and deployed on the university campus.
The project involves learning several key concepts, including image processing, computer vision, and machine learning.
